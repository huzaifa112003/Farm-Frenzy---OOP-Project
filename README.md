# Farm-Frenzy---OOP-Project
Hi guys! this is the space we can share our code and upload changs an out parts done.
Project Proposal: Farm Frenzy Game 
Introduction: The Farm Frenzy game is a popular simulation game where players manage a farm and take care of various animals and crops. In this project, we will create a Farm Frenzy game using object-oriented programming in C++.
Objectives: The objectives of this project are as follows:

Implement object-oriented programming principles in C++

Develop a Farm Frenzy game that is engaging and fun to play

Allow players to manage a farm, take care of animals, and harvest crops

Develop an easy-to-use user interface for the game

Features: The Farm Frenzy game will have the following features:

A farm that includes a variety of animals and crops

An inventory system that tracks the player's resources, such as money and feed

A market where players can buy and sell goods

A tutorial that teaches players how to play the game

The player will have to feed animals in time and collect the goods like eggs from chicken, milk from cows on time, these items will be created randomly on the runtime and will be saved in a dynamically created array. The player will have to collect the item before it disappears. They key to last longest will be managing time well.

A scoring system that rates the player's performance

Implementation: The Farm Frenzy game The game will be divided into classes, each representing a different aspect of the game, such as the farm, animals, crops, inventory, and market.
The farm class will contain information about the farm, such as the size of the farm and the location of the animal pens and crop fields. The animal and crop classes will contain information about the different types of animals and crops available in the game. The inventory class will track the player's resources, such as money and feed, while the market class will allow players to buy and sell goods.
The user interface for the game will be developed using a graphical user interface SDL2 library. The GUI will include buttons and menus for the player to interact with the game.
Conclusion: In conclusion, this project aims to create a fun and engaging Farm Frenzy game using object-oriented programming principles in C++. By dividing the game into classes, we will be able to create a modular and extensible game that can be easily modified and expanded. The user interface will be easy to use and intuitive, allowing players to quickly learn and enjoy the game.
